I hoped it would be a joke… but I was doing my daily visit to the hospital when they told me the news : my husband ceased to live. I don’t know how but I was able to regain my home… I opened my medallion again to see the face of my husband… But I only realized it was making the mourning more difficult… So I took a decision : I removed my medallion from my neck and left it in the attic where the memories and forgotten items are stored.. But I must have lost the chain somewhere along the way to the attic, I didn’t have it with me.. I wonder where I left it ?
