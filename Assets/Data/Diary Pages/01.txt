Dear diary,

Usually, I’m not the kind of person that keeps up a diary. But today, I got the need to put my thoughts on paper. My beloved got hospitalized… If it wasn’t hurtful enough, I learned that he delayed his appointment with the doctor. I knew he loved to be free but at what price ? He told me to not be worried but it’s impossible… How can I be calm when he is diagnosed with a lung cancer ? I don’t know what the future have in store for us but I hope it’ll be good news…
