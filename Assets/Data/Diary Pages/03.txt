Dear diary

I visited my husband at the hospital again… He was so quiet that the silence became soon enough unbearable. And when he spoke, it was the same sentence again and again : “please let me die”... Why ? why ? why ? why ? don’t you want to live ? Weren’t you the one that was always chatty ? So why did you stop ? Why ? why ? why ?
Writing in this diary doesn’t help me at all, I’m just venting my anger… I think I’ll rely on my medallion to help me endure through it.
