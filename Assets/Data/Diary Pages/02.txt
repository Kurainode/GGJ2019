Dear diary…

I hoped that I wouldn’t come here again but look who is writing… My husband got admitted in intensive care and… well… he doesn’t look the same anymore. He loved to smile but nowadays it’s so hard to see him laughing… It’s even harder when all you can think is the happy memories from the past… I have this image of him engraved in my mind : the smile he made when he gave me a little music box. The first gift at our first date and it was so unexpected : I can’t believe he saw my interest in this little object. Turn the handle six time in a clockwise direction and the box will open in the center to unveil a little dancer moving along the rhythm of the music… what a beautiful melody…
