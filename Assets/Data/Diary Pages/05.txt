Dear diary,

I think that life is mean to be ended and that the living must be strong and enjoying life for the ones who can’t anymore. I must start a life anew and that’s why I will take off my wedding ring and leave it to the soul of the house, the one that saw all our “sweet home” life. It’ll be all for the better. He will become the guardian of our memories, our lost daily routine.
